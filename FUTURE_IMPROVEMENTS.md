# Future Improvements for Go-Cache

This document outlines potential features and enhancements for future versions of the library. Contributions are welcome!

## Core Features

-   **Asynchronous Redis Operations**
    -   **Description**: Currently, `Set` and `Purge` operations block until the Redis command completes. For write-heavy workloads, these operations could be made asynchronous (fire-and-forget) to improve the application's responsiveness.
    -   **Implementation**: Use goroutines for Redis writes. Add an option to enable/disable this behavior.

-   **Cache Stampede Protection (Thundering Herd)**
    -   **Description**: When a very popular cached item expires, multiple concurrent requests might try to fetch the data from the primary source at the same time. This can overload the source.
    -   **Implementation**: Use a mechanism like `golang.org/x/sync/singleflight` to ensure that for a given key, only one fetch operation is executed while other requests wait for the result.

-   **Context Propagation**
    -   **Description**: Add `context.Context` as the first parameter to all public methods (`Get`, `Set`, `Purge`). This is a standard pattern in modern Go libraries.
    -   **Benefits**: Allows for request cancellation, deadlines, and passing request-scoped values.

## Extensibility & Flexibility

-   **Pluggable Backends**
    -   **Description**: Abstract the cache backend into an interface. While Redis is the current backend, this would allow users to implement their own storage solutions (e.g., Memcached, or even a simple file-based cache).

-   **Custom Serialization**
    -   **Description**: The library currently works with `[]byte`. Allow users to provide their own serialization/deserialization logic (e.g., JSON, Gob, ProtoBuf) via an interface.

## Monitoring & Reliability

-   **Advanced Metrics**
    -   **Description**: Expose more detailed metrics for monitoring.
    -   **Examples**: Hit/miss ratio for both memory and Redis layers, latency for cache operations, number of active goroutines, etc.
    -   **Implementation**: Integrate with a standard metrics library like Prometheus.

-   **Granular Error Types**
    -   **Description**: Provide more specific error types to allow users to distinguish between different failure modes (e.g., `ErrRedisDown`, `ErrSerialization`, `ErrContextCancelled`).

## Project Health

-   **Benchmarking Suite**
    -   **Description**: Add a comprehensive set of benchmarks to measure the performance of `Get`, `Set`, and `Purge` operations under various conditions (e.g., high concurrency, large data sets).
    -   **Benefits**: Helps track performance regressions and validate improvements.
